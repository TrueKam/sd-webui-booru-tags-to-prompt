# BooruLinkPrompt
A StableDiffusion-WebUI Forge script to get a list of tags from supported image boards and add to a prompt.

## Future Plans
- Add support for other boorus. Currently planned supported URLs are: danbooru.donmai.us, chan.sankakucomplex.com, idol.sankakucomplex.com, and aibooru.online

## Version History
- 1.0.0
    - Initial commit. Code functions perfectly well, but only supports gelbooru.com.
- 1.1.0
    - Refactored functionality when button is pressed to parse the URL passed in before attempting to fetch. It still only supports gelbooru.com URLs, but the framework is now in place to allow the rest to be written.
