## Version History
- 1.7.1
    - Gelbooru removed (or changed the URL for, or simply changed permissions for) their API, so the method I was using to get the tags no longer works. Reworked the algorithm to get the tags so it just uses the originally downloaded HTML instead of parsing that for the image's hash then contacting the API. The API was more elegant, but technically caused a second web call so this is a faster solution.
- 1.7.0
  - Added support for tbib.org (The Big Image Board) and e621.net.
- 1.6.0
  - Added support for safebooru.org URLs.
- 1.5.0
  - Added support for chan.sankakucomplex.com and idol.sankakucomplex.com.
- 1.4.0
  - Added support for rule34.xxx links.
- 1.3.1
  - Fixed typo causing Danbooru and AIbooru links containing URL query parameters (usually from site searches) causing errors when trying to fetch.
- 1.3.0
  - AIbooru links are now supported.
- 1.2.0
  - Danbooru links are now supported.
- 1.1.5
  - Refactored to remove redundant URL check and updated gelbooru fetch user agent.
- 1.1.0
  - Refactored functionality when button is pressed to parse the URL passed in before attempting to fetch. It still only supports gelbooru.com URLs, but the framework is now in place to allow the rest to be written.
- 1.0.0
